This challenge demostrates the TTD method. I used jest to code up the test for each of the constructor function. I, then, coded up each constructor function to pass the test. By coding this way, I was guarantee for the function to function correctly. The TTD method also aided in the process of debugging, and ensure that your code is a MVP.
